# Link-in-Bio
This GitHub repository serves as my official hosting location for my Link-in-Bio page. It contains a simple website using GitHub Pages and a domain name that I own to host it at "https://bio.astrus.live/" in where a user can retrieve the link in the bio of my social media profiles to get access to the rest of the platforms that I use. Feel free to fork this repository to build your own link-in-bio website.
